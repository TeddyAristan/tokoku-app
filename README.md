# TokoKu-app

<p>
TokoKu is an android mobile application that built using kotlin language with MVVM (Model View ViewModel) Architecture and Agile Framework in Android Studio platform. The main purpose of TokoKu Application is to help mini grocery sellers that seldom forget the price of items and the transaction processes held manually.

The features in this TokoKu application are CRUD list of goods (name, type, quantity, lower limit price, upper limit price, and photo), and CRUD list of customers who have not paid. The registered item data will be stored in the local database for the current mobile application development. The drawback that needs to be considered is that the data will be lost if the application is deleted or uninstalled by the user.

The uncertainty of the UI and Attributes to be used along with the limitations of my current capabilities in mobile development are the reasons the developer use the Agile Framework as a development method. Here is a little sample of the UI that the developer designed myself at first, which can be seen below.

The development of this application is still at the first stage where CRUD requirements can be used. However, this application in terms of security has not been implemented so that if installed in apk, a warning notification will appear from the android system itself. The development of other features and application security features that are in accordance with the standards will be included in the new sprint stage because the application development phase I has been completed and on target with a duration of two weeks.

Stay tune for the update or maybe we can collabe to optimize this application :), feel excited for the collaboration....
